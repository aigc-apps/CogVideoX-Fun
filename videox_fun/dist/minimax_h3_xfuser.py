class MiniMaxH3MultiGPUsAttnProcessor:
    """
    Sequence parallel attention processor for MiniMax-H3.

    MiniMax-H3 runs full self-attention over one packed sequence, so every rank holds a contiguous slice of the rows
    and the sequence-parallel group turns that row split into a head split: `xFuserLongContextAttention` all-to-alls
    the queries, keys and values so that every rank attends over the whole sequence with a subset of the heads, then
    all-to-alls the context back onto the rank's own rows. This is the path every other model of the repository takes
    (Wan, HunyuanVideo, QwenImage, ...), and it keeps the local attention square — `q_len == k_len` — so the very
    same kernel serves the single-GPU and the multi-GPU runs.

    The packed sequence is padded up to a multiple of the group size before it is split, so the sequence the heads
    attend over carries at most `sp_world_size - 1` padding rows. Their projections are zero, which leaves them as
    `exp(0)` terms of a softmax over ~1e5 rows — a ~1e-5 relative dilution. `valid_length` is therefore only accepted
    for signature compatibility with the single-GPU processor and is not used.
