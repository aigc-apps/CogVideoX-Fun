MiniMax-H3 text/keyframe/reference to video + audio pipeline.

MiniMax-H3 generates a video and its soundtrack **jointly**: one transformer denoises a single packed sequence that
holds the text conditioning, the conditioning rows, the target audio rows and the target video rows at once, with
full self-attention over all of it. There is no separate vocoder and no audio post-hoc pass.

The row order of a `t2va` / `fl2va` request is

```
[ text (L) | keyframe conditions (C) | target audio (A) | target video (V) ]
```

and a `ref2va` request interleaves one block per reference — image, video with its soundtrack, or audio clip — in
request order between the text and the generated rows. The order is semantic twice over: it labels the references
in the prompt presentation and it advances the shared audio/video rotary clock, so a different order is a different
request.

and the geometry helpers of this module exist to place a row in that sequence and to give it its `(t, h, w)` rotary
coordinate. The coordinates are built in float64 because video and audio share one 40-units-per-second rotary clock —
video advances `5/3` rotary units per pixel frame at 24 fps, audio advances one unit per latent at 40 latents/s — and
that shared clock *is* the audio/video alignment.

The released checkpoint is guidance-distilled: guidance is baked into the weights, so the default `guidance_scale`
of `1` runs exactly one forward pass per step with no CFG. A `guidance_scale` above `1` enables classifier-free
guidance with a `negative_prompt`, running two forward passes per step.

    Build the `[text | target audio | target video]` layout of a multiview request.

    The target video rows hold the views concatenated in view-major order — all rows of view 0 first, then view 1,

    transformer's `view_tags` address them. The rotary time axis restarts at the same origin for every view, so
    each view keeps the single-view temporal RoPE the base model was pre-trained with, and the full self-attention
    of the packed sequence couples the views. `video_view_tags` carries the view id of every video row for the
    transformer's view embeddings.

        then merges the sampled frames in groups of `temporal_patch` — repeating the last one when the count does not
        divide — and a merged group is labelled with the mean of its timestamps, which `"<{timestamp:.1f} seconds>"`
        renders with Python's round-half-to-even, so the first block of a 2 fps pair is `"<0.2 seconds>"` rather than
        `"<0.3 seconds>"`.

        Generate a video and its soundtrack, as a `t2va`, an `fl2va` or a `ref2va` request.

        Args:
            prompt (`str`):
                The prompt to guide generation. MiniMax-H3 packs one request into one sequence, so a batch of prompts
                is not a thing.
            image (`PIL.Image.Image`, *optional*):
                Keyframe the video starts from. It is *stretched* onto the target canvas, which by default is derived
                from its own aspect ratio. Mutually exclusive with `references`.
            last_image (`PIL.Image.Image`, *optional*):
                Keyframe the video ends on. Can be passed on its own to generate *up to* a frame. Combined with
                `image` it is the follower of the two and is cover-cropped onto the canvas. Mutually exclusive with
                `references`.
            references (`list[MiniMaxH3Reference]`, *optional*):
                The `ref2va` references to condition on, **in the order the model should read them**: the order
                labels them in the prompt presentation and lays them out on the shared rotary clock, so a different
                order is a different request. One dataclass per modality, all holding in-memory media — a
                [`MiniMaxH3ImageReference`] (at most 9), a [`MiniMaxH3VideoReference`] at its own `fps` (at most 3,
                whose `audio` soundtrack is conditioned on as well), or a [`MiniMaxH3AudioReference`] at its own
                `sample_rate` (at most 3) — for at most 12 references in total, and audio references cannot be the
                only ones. Decode files with each class's `from_file` classmethod, which brings the rates along. The
                `ref2va` checkpoint is guidance-distilled with no unconditional branch, so `references` needs
                `guidance_scale <= 1`, and it needs a transformer loaded from `transformer_ref`.
            height (`int`, *optional*):
                Height of the generated video in pixels, a multiple of 32. Defaults to MiniMax-H3's own canvas for the
                aspect ratio of the first keyframe, or 16:9 without one.
            width (`int`, *optional*):
                Width of the generated video in pixels, a multiple of 32.
            num_frames (`int`, defaults to `124`):
                Number of frames to generate, at the fixed 24 fps. Snapped up to the next `17 * n + 5` the video VAE
                can decode; the resulting duration must stay between 5 and 15 seconds.
            num_inference_steps (`int`, defaults to `50`):
                Number of denoising steps, i.e. of model evaluations. The sigma grid it is built from holds one more
                point than that, the terminal `0`.
            flow_shift (`float`, *optional*):
                Overrides the video schedule's exponential shift (`12.0` in the released checkpoints).
            audio_flow_shift (`float`, *optional*):
                Overrides the audio schedule's exponential shift (`3.0` in the released checkpoints).
            guidance_scale (`float`, defaults to `1.0`):
                Classifier-free guidance scale. The released checkpoint is guidance-distilled, so the default `1.0`
                disables CFG and runs one forward pass per step. A value above `1.0` enables CFG with
                `negative_prompt`, running two forward passes per step.
            negative_prompt (`str`, *optional*):
                The prompt that guides what to exclude from generation, used when `guidance_scale > 1`. Defaults to an
                empty string when `guidance_scale > 1` and `negative_prompt` is `None`.
            generator (`torch.Generator`, *optional*):
                The generator of the request. A request draws the keyframe conditioning noise first, then the video
                noise, then the audio noise, so two runs from the same generator state return the same video and
                soundtrack.
            latents (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated video noise of shape `(1, 24, num_latent_frames, latent_height, latent_width)`, used
                instead of the draw.
            audio_latents (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                Pre-generated audio noise of shape `(2, 32, num_audio_latents)`.
            prompt_embeds (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                A pre-computed conditioning of shape `(1, num_text_tokens, 5120)`, used instead of running the
                conditioner. Passed together with `text_token_tags`, it lets a caller that has cached its prompts keep
                the 62 GB Qwen3-VL conditioner out of the run entirely.
            text_token_tags (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
                The `(num_text_tokens,)` per-row modality tags that go with `prompt_embeds`.
            normalized_references (`list`, *optional*):
                References already put through [`normalize_ref2va_references`], used instead of normalizing
                `references` again. Together with `condition_latents` the only fields read off them are `kind` and
                `has_audio`, so a caller working from a cache may pass lightweight stand-ins.
            condition_latents (`torch.Tensor` or `list[torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                Pre-encoded visual conditioning. A list is the `ref2va` reference latents already produced by
                [`~MiniMaxH3Pipeline.encode_reference_latents`]; a tensor is the `fl2va` keyframe rows.
            audio_condition_latents (`list[torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                Pre-encoded `ref2va` soundtrack latents, used together with `condition_latents` so the video VAE
                encoder stays out of the request.
            output_type (`str`, defaults to `"pt"`):
                Output format: `"pil"`, `"np"`, `"pt"`, or `"latent"` for the raw latents.
            return_dict (`bool`, defaults to `True`):
                Whether to return a [`MiniMaxH3PipelineOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
            attention_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
                A kwargs dictionary that, if specified, may carry a `scale` entry which is applied to the LoRA layers.
            callback_on_step_end (`Callable`, *optional*):
                A function called at the end of every denoising step.
            callback_on_step_end_tensor_inputs (`list[str]`, defaults to `["latents"]`):
                The tensors of the loop the callback is handed.

        Returns:
            [`MiniMaxH3PipelineOutput`] or `tuple`:
                The generated video, the stereo soundtrack of shape `(1, 2, num_samples)` and its sample rate. Muxing
                the two into one file is left to the caller, e.g. with `save_videos_with_audio_grid`.
