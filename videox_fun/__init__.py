# and costs exactly what it did before. (`videox_fun.utils` exports from it and so loads it either way, which buys
# nothing but a bytecode load -- the module imports only the standard library and `torch`.) Here rather than in
# `videox_fun.pipeline` because the training scripts are what this measures, and three of them never import that
# package -- but all 113 of them import `videox_fun.models`, which this reaches through.
