### 1.4 Weight Placement

We'd better place the [weights](#iii-supported-models) along the specified path:

**Via ComfyUI**:
Put the models into the ComfyUI weights folder `ComfyUI/models/Fun_Models/`:
```
📦 ComfyUI/
├── 📂 models/
│   └── 📂 Fun_Models/
│       ├── 📂 CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-2b-InP/
│       ├── 📂 CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-5b-InP/
│       ├── 📂 Wan2.1-Fun-14B-InP
│       └── 📂 Wan2.1-Fun-1.3B-InP/
```

**Run its own python file or UI interface**:
```
📦 models/
├── 📂 Diffusion_Transformer/
│   ├── 📂 CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-2b-InP/
│   ├── 📂 CogVideoX-Fun-V1.1-5b-InP/

```

## 2. Inference Generation

<a id="video-gen"></a>

Video and image models share the exact same inference entry, provided by scripts or UI under `examples/{model_name}/`.

### 2.1 Entry Selection

| Entry | Suitable Scenario | Config Granularity |
|--|--|--|
| Python file | Batch generation, parameter debugging | Full parameters |
| WebUI | Interactive experience | Common parameters only |
| ComfyUI | Existing ComfyUI workflow | Node parameters |

Table: inference entry selection

### 2.2 GPU Memory Saving Options

Since Wan2.1 has a very large number of parameters, we need to consider memory optimization strategies to adapt to consumer-grade GPUs. We provide `GPU_memory_mode` for each prediction file, allowing you to choose between `model_cpu_offload`, `model_cpu_offload_and_qfloat8`, and `sequential_cpu_offload`. This solution is also applicable to CogVideoX-Fun generation.

- `model_cpu_offload`: The entire model is moved to the CPU after use, saving some GPU memory.
- `model_cpu_offload_and_qfloat8`: The entire model is moved to the CPU after use, and the transformer model is quantized to float8, saving more GPU memory.
- `sequential_cpu_offload`: Each layer of the model is moved to the CPU after use. It is slower but saves a significant amount of GPU memory.

`qfloat8` may slightly reduce model performance but saves more GPU memory. If you have sufficient GPU memory, it is recommended to use `model_cpu_offload`.

### 2.3 Via Python Files

##### i. Single-GPU Inference:

- **Step 1**: Download the corresponding [weights](#iii-supported-models) and place them in the `models` folder.
- **Step 2**: Use different files for prediction based on the weights and prediction goals. This library currently supports CogVideoX-Fun, Wan2.1, and Wan2.1-Fun. Different models are distinguished by folder names under the `examples` folder, and their supported features vary. Use them accordingly. Below is an example using CogVideoX-Fun:
  - **Text-to-Video**:
    - Modify `prompt`, `neg_prompt`, `guidance_scale`, and `seed` in the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_t2v.py`.
    - Run the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_t2v.py` and wait for the results. The generated videos will be saved in the folder `samples/cogvideox-fun-videos`.
  - **Image-to-Video**:
    - Modify `validation_image_start`, `validation_image_end`, `prompt`, `neg_prompt`, `guidance_scale`, and `seed` in the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_i2v.py`.
    - `validation_image_start` is the starting image of the video, and `validation_image_end` is the ending image of the video.
    - Run the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_i2v.py` and wait for the results. The generated videos will be saved in the folder `samples/cogvideox-fun-videos_i2v`.
  - **Video-to-Video**:
    - Modify `validation_video`, `validation_image_end`, `prompt`, `neg_prompt`, `guidance_scale`, and `seed` in the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_v2v.py`.
    - `validation_video` is the reference video for video-to-video generation. You can use the following demo video: [Demo Video](https://pai-aigc-photog.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/cogvideox_fun/asset/v1/play_guitar.mp4).
    - Run the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_v2v.py` and wait for the results. The generated videos will be saved in the folder `samples/cogvideox-fun-videos_v2v`.
  - **Controlled Video Generation (Canny, Pose, Depth, etc.)**:
    - Modify `control_video`, `validation_image_end`, `prompt`, `neg_prompt`, `guidance_scale`, and `seed` in the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_v2v_control.py`.
    - `control_video` is the control video extracted using operators such as Canny, Pose, or Depth. You can use the following demo video: [Demo Video](https://pai-aigc-photog.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/cogvideox_fun/asset/v1.1/pose.mp4).
    - Run the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/predict_v2v_control.py` and wait for the results. The generated videos will be saved in the folder `samples/cogvideox-fun-videos_v2v_control`.
- **Step 3**: If you want to integrate other backbones or Loras trained by yourself, modify `lora_path` and relevant paths in `examples/{model_name}/predict_t2v.py` or `examples/{model_name}/predict_i2v.py` as needed.

##### ii. Multi-GPU Inference:
When using multi-GPU inference, please make sure to install the xfuser. We recommend installing xfuser==0.4.2 and yunchang==0.6.2.
```
pip install xfuser==0.4.2 --progress-bar off -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
pip install yunchang==0.6.2 --progress-bar off -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
```

Please ensure that the product of `ulysses_degree` and `ring_degree` equals the number of GPUs being used. For example, if you are using 8 GPUs, you can set `ulysses_degree=2` and `ring_degree=4`, or alternatively `ulysses_degree=4` and `ring_degree=2`.

- `ulysses_degree` performs parallelization after splitting across the heads.
- `ring_degree` performs parallelization after splitting across the sequence.

Compared to `ulysses_degree`, `ring_degree` incurs higher communication costs. Therefore, when setting these parameters, you should take into account both the sequence length and the number of heads in the model.

Let’s take 8-GPU parallel inference as an example:

- **For Wan2.1-Fun-V1.1-14B-InP**, which has 40 heads, `ulysses_degree` should be set to a divisor of 40 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, etc.). Thus, when using 8 GPUs for parallel inference, you can set `ulysses_degree=8` and `ring_degree=1`.

- **For Wan2.1-Fun-V1.1-1.3B-InP**, which has 12 heads, `ulysses_degree` should be set to a divisor of 12 (e.g., 2, 4, etc.). Thus, when using 8 GPUs for parallel inference, you can set `ulysses_degree=4` and `ring_degree=2`.

After setting the parameters, run the following command for parallel inference:

```sh
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 examples/wan2.1_fun/predict_t2v.py
```

### 2.4 Via the Web UI

The web UI supports text-to-video, image-to-video, video-to-video, and controlled video generation (Canny, Pose, Depth, etc.). This library currently supports CogVideoX-Fun, Wan2.1, and Wan2.1-Fun. Different models are distinguished by folder names under the `examples` folder, and their supported features vary. Use them accordingly. Below is an example using CogVideoX-Fun:

- **Step 1**: Download the corresponding [weights](#iii-supported-models) and place them in the `models` folder.
- **Step 2**: Run the file `examples/cogvideox_fun/app.py` to access the Gradio interface.
- **Step 3**: Select the generation model on the page, fill in `prompt`, `neg_prompt`, `guidance_scale`, and `seed`, click "Generate," and wait for the results. The generated videos will be saved in the `sample` folder.

### 2.5 Via ComfyUI

For details, refer to [ComfyUI README](comfyui/README.md).


## 3. Model Training

A complete model training pipeline consists of data preprocessing and Video DiT training.

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing

<a id="data-preprocess"></a>
Training documents for each model are unified under `scripts/{model_name}/`. For details, see [3.3 Training Documents per Model](#33-training-documents-per-model).

A complete data preprocessing link for long video segmentation, cleaning, and description can refer to [README](videox_fun/video_caption/README.md) in the video captions section. 

If you want to train a text to image and video generation model. You need to arrange the dataset in this format.

```
📦 project/
├── 📂 datasets/
│   ├── 📂 internal_datasets/
│       ├── 📂 train/
│       │   ├── 📄 00000001.mp4
│       │   ├── 📄 00000002.jpg
│       │   └── 📄 .....
│       └── 📄 json_of_internal_datasets.json
```

The json_of_internal_datasets.json is a standard JSON file. The file_path in the json can to be set as relative path, as shown in below:
```json
[
    {
      "file_path": "train/00000001.mp4",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "video"
    },
    {
      "file_path": "train/00000002.jpg",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "image"
    },
    .....
]
```

You can also set the path as absolute path as follow:
```json
[
    {
      "file_path": "/mnt/data/videos/00000001.mp4",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "video"
    },
    {
      "file_path": "/mnt/data/train/00000001.jpg",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "image"
    },
    .....
]
```

### 3.2 Video DiT Training

<a id="dit-train"></a>
The training scripts and launch sh files for each model are located under `scripts/{model_name}/`. The sh file names vary by task, such as `train.sh`, `train_lora.sh`, `train_control.sh`, `train_control_distill.sh`, etc.; refer to the actual files in the directory.

If the data format is relative path during data preprocessing, please set ```scripts/{model_name}/train.sh``` as follow.
```
export DATASET_NAME="datasets/internal_datasets/"
export DATASET_META_NAME="datasets/internal_datasets/json_of_internal_datasets.json"
```

If the data format is absolute path during data preprocessing, please set ```scripts/{model_name}/train.sh``` as follow (`DATASET_NAME` is left empty so the dataset directory prefix is no longer concatenated).
```
export DATASET_NAME=""
export DATASET_META_NAME="/mnt/data/json_of_internal_datasets.json"
```

Finally, run the corresponding script.
```sh
sh scripts/{model_name}/train.sh
```

### 3.3 Training Documents per Model

> Notes:
> - Audio-driven and reference models (FantasyTalking, InfiniteTalk, Phantom) are incremental weights and must be used together with the corresponding base video weights and audio encoder.
> - Distillation schemes such as TurboDiffusion have no publicly released weights; train them following `scripts/{model_name}/README_TRAIN*.md` and then fill the resulting path into `transformer_path`.
> - Weight names map one-to-one to folder names under `models/Diffusion_Transformer/`. Weights within the same family are not interchangeable; choose according to the inference task. If a weight is not listed here, it is either produced by this project or should be obtained from the upstream official repository.

# VII. Limitations and Risks

- Generated videos may have artifacts or quality issues, especially in complex scenes.
- The model may struggle with fine details, text rendering, or specific artistic styles.
- Performance varies with input prompt quality, resolution, and other parameters.
- The technology could be misused to create misleading content (e.g., deepfakes). Users are responsible for ethical use.
- The model may reflect biases present in the training data.
- Users should respect privacy and copyright when using real people's images or videos.

We encourage responsible use and recommend implementing safeguards in production environments.
