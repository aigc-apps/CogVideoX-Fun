# Introduction
CogVideoX-Fun is a modified pipeline based on the CogVideoX structure, designed to provide more flexibility in generation. It can be used to create AI images and videos, as well as to train baseline models and Lora models for Diffusion Transformer. We support predictions directly from the already trained CogVideoX-Fun model, allowing the generation of videos at different resolutions, approximately 6 seconds long with 8 fps (1 to 49 frames). Users can also train their own baseline models and Lora models to achieve certain style transformations.

We will support quick pull-ups from different platforms, refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start).

What's New:
- Create code! Now supporting Windows and Linux. Supports video generation at any resolution from 256x256x49 to 1024x1024x49. [ 2024.09.09 ]

Functionï¼š
- [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocess)
- [Train DiT](#dit-train)
- [Video Generation](#video-gen)

These are our generated results [GALLERY](scripts/Result_Gallery.md) (Click the image below to see the video):

Our UI interface is as follows:

# enter image
docker run -it -p 7860:7860 --network host --gpus all --security-opt seccomp:unconfined --shm-size 200g mybigpai-public-registry.cn-beijing.cr.aliyuncs.com/easycv/torch_cuda:cogvideox_fun

# clone code
git clone https://github.com/aigc-apps/CogVideoX-Fun.git

# enter CogVideoX-Fun's dir
cd CogVideoX-Fun

# download weights
mkdir models/Diffusion_Transformer

We need about 60GB available on disk (for saving weights), please check!

#### b. Weights
We'd better place the [weights](#model-zoo) along the specified path:

```
ðŸ“¦ models/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Diffusion_Transformer/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ CogVideoX-Fun-2b-InP/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Personalized_Model/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your trained trainformer model / your trained lora model (for UI load)
```

# How to use

<h3 id="video-gen">1. Inference </h3>

#### a. Using Python Code
- Step 1: Download the corresponding [weights](#model-zoo) and place them in the models folder.
- Step 2: Modify prompt, neg_prompt, guidance_scale, and seed in the predict_t2v.py file.
- Step 3: Run the predict_t2v.py file, wait for the generated results, and save the results in the samples/cogvideox-fun-videos-t2v folder.
- Step 4: If you want to combine other backbones you have trained with Lora, modify the predict_t2v.py and Lora_path in predict_t2v.py depending on the situation.

#### b. Using webui
- Step 1: Download the corresponding [weights](#model-zoo) and place them in the models folder.
- Step 2: Run the app.py file to enter the graph page.
- Step 3: Select the generated model based on the page, fill in prompt, neg_prompt, guidance_scale, and seed, click on generate, wait for the generated result, and save the result in the samples folder.

#### c. From ComfyUI
Please refer to [ComfyUI README](comfyui/README.md) for details.

### 2. Model Training
A complete CogVideoX-Fun training pipeline should include data preprocessing, and Video DiT training. 

<h4 id="data-preprocess">a. data preprocessing</h4>

We have provided a simple demo of training the Lora model through image data, which can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/aigc-apps/CogVideoX-Fun/wiki/Training-Lora) for details.

A complete data preprocessing link for long video segmentation, cleaning, and description can refer to [README](cogvideox/video_caption/README.md) in the video captions section. 

If you want to train a text to image and video generation model. You need to arrange the dataset in this format.

```
ðŸ“¦ project/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ datasets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ internal_datasets/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ train/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ 00000001.mp4
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ 00000002.jpg
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ .....
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ json_of_internal_datasets.json
```

The json_of_internal_datasets.json is a standard JSON file. The file_path in the json can to be set as relative path, as shown in below:
```json
[
    {
      "file_path": "train/00000001.mp4",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "video"
    },
    {
      "file_path": "train/00000002.jpg",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "image"
    },
    .....
]
```

You can also set the path as absolute path as follow:
```json
[
    {
      "file_path": "/mnt/data/videos/00000001.mp4",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "video"
    },
    {
      "file_path": "/mnt/data/train/00000001.jpg",
      "text": "A group of young men in suits and sunglasses are walking down a city street.",
      "type": "image"
    },
    .....
]
```

<h4 id="dit-train">b. Video DiT training </h4>
 
If the data format is relative path during data preprocessing, please set ```scripts/train.sh``` as follow.
```
export DATASET_NAME="datasets/internal_datasets/"
export DATASET_META_NAME="datasets/internal_datasets/json_of_internal_datasets.json"
```

If the data format is absolute path during data preprocessing, please set ```scripts/train.sh``` as follow.
```
export DATASET_NAME=""
export DATASET_META_NAME="/mnt/data/json_of_internal_datasets.json"
```

Then, we run scripts/train.sh.
```sh
sh scripts/train.sh
```

For details on setting some parameters, please refer to [Readme Train](scripts/README_TRAIN.md) and [Readme Lora](scripts/README_TRAIN_LORA.md).
